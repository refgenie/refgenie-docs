# Clients and Agents

`refget` defines a `Client` as **Python class for interacting with a remote Refget API**. If you want to **use** a refget service in your application, you can use refget to provide a Python client for you.

`refget` defines an `Agent` as a **Python class for interacting with a database to produce an API**. If you want to **create** a refget service, or otherwise host your own refget database, then you can use refget Agents.
